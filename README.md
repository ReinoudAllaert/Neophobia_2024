  - `2024_chick_data.xlsx`: Primary dataset of individual-level behavioural observations.
  - `BORIS_IRR_SB.csv`: Behavioural coding data from one observer for inter-rater reliability.
  - `BORIS_RA.csv`: Behavioural coding data from a second observer.
  - `BORIS_SK.csv`: Behavioural coding data from a third observer.
  - `metadata.xlsx`: Metadata for the raw data files.

- **processed_data/**: Contains processed data that has been cleaned and prepared for analysis, including:
  - `neophobia_data.csv`: Fully processed dataset used for statistical analysis.
  - `neophobia_data_IRR.csv`: Data prepared for inter-rater reliability analysis.
  - `videos_for_doublecoding.csv`: Information on the videos selected for double coding.

### Scripts
- **IRR.R**: Script for calculating inter-rater reliability (IRR) using Cohenâ€™s Kappa for the coded behavioural data.
- **preprocessing.R**: Script for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data before analysis.
- **analysis.R**: Main R script containing statistical models and data analysis pipeline.
- **analysis.Rmd**: R Markdown file with detailed steps for data analysis and result interpretation.
- **analysis.html**: Rendered HTML report of the `analysis.Rmd` file.
